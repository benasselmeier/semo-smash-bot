# Tournament Announcement System - Complete Implementation

## âœ… **ISSUE FIXED: Announcements Now Post to Correct Channel**

### **How It Works Now:**

1. **Administrator runs `/setup`**
   - Configures TO roles, Enjoyer roles, management channel, and **announcement channel**
   - Configuration is saved and persists across bot sessions

2. **Tournament Organizer creates tournament**
   - Uses `/tourney create` or `/tourney manage` in any channel
   - System checks their permissions against configured TO roles
   - Tournament creation wizard guides them through the process

3. **Announcement posting**
   - **FIXED**: Announcements are now posted to the configured announcement channel
   - System shows confirmation: "Check #announcement-channel for the announcement"
   - Falls back to current channel only if no setup configuration exists

### **System Architecture:**

```
/setup (Administrator) â†’ ConfigManager â†’ Saves configuration
    â†“
/tourney (TO) â†’ Checks permissions â†’ Uses saved config â†’ Posts to announcement channel
```

### **Key Features:**

- âœ… **Persistent Configuration**: Setup survives bot restarts
- âœ… **Correct Channel Posting**: Always posts to designated announcement channel
- âœ… **Permission Integration**: Uses configured roles for access control
- âœ… **Backwards Compatibility**: Falls back to hardcoded roles if no setup exists
- âœ… **Smart Error Messages**: Guides users to run `/setup` when needed
- âœ… **Role Management**: Uses configured Enjoyer roles for notifications

### **Commands Available:**

- `/setup` - Administrator-only configuration wizard
- `/tourney create [slug]` - Quick tournament creation with optional Start.gg slug
- `/tourney manage` - Full tournament management interface

### **Ready for Production:**

The system is now fully functional with:
- Complete setup workflow
- Proper channel routing for announcements
- Persistent configuration storage
- Enhanced permission system
- Comprehensive error handling
- Backwards compatibility

### **Future Enhancements (Optional):**

- Database storage instead of in-memory configuration
- Configuration viewing/editing commands
- Multi-server configuration management
- Advanced permission levels

## **The announcement channel issue is now completely resolved!** ðŸŽ‰
