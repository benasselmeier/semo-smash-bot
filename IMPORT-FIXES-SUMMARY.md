# Import Command Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues
1. **GraphQL Schema Error**: "Cannot query field 'selections' on type 'SetSlot'"
   - Removed invalid `selections` field from the GraphQL query
   - Updated character data handling in the code

2. **Query Complexity Error**: "Your query complexity is too high. A maximum of 1000 objects may be returned"
   - Reduced page size from 25 to 15 sets per request
   - Limited total sets per event to 300 (down from 500)
   - Removed unnecessary fields from the query to reduce complexity
   - Increased delay between API requests to 2 seconds
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added specific handling for query complexity errors
   - Improved user-friendly error messages with troubleshooting tips

## Updated Files
1. `src/commands/import_new.js`
   - Fixed GraphQL query structure
   - Improved pagination handling
   - Enhanced error reporting
   - Removed invalid character selection code

2. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
   - Added section for query complexity errors
   - Added advanced troubleshooting tips
   - Included information about character data limitations

3. `README.md`
   - Updated Start.gg integration section
   - Added information about API limitations
   - Enhanced troubleshooting section

## Testing
Created test scripts to validate the implementation:
- `test-import-command.js` - Tests the import command with real data
- `validate-query.js` - Validates the GraphQL query structure

## Next Steps
1. Test the command with actual tournaments to verify fixes work
2. Consider implementing more sophisticated rate limiting if needed
3. Monitor Start.gg API changes for any schema updates

The bot should now handle large tournaments more effectively by:
1. Fetching data in smaller chunks (15 sets per request)
2. Setting appropriate limits to avoid complexity issues (300 sets max per event)
3. Adding proper delays between API calls (2 seconds)
4. Gracefully handling and reporting errors
