# Missouri Region Designations and Chronological Sorting - Implementation Complete

## ✅ **Features Implemented**

### **1. Missouri Region Designations**
- Added regional identifiers for Missouri events that display above tournament titles
- Regional mappings for each TO role:
  - `TO (St. Louis)` → `[STL]`
  - `TO (Jefferson City)` → `[JC]`
  - `TO (CoMo)` → `[CoMo]`
  - `TO (Kansas City)` → `[KC]`
  - `TO (Springfield)` → `[SGF]`
  - `TO (Rolla)` → `[Rolla]`

### **2. Chronological Event Sorting**
- Events are now sorted by date when adding to existing multi-event announcements
- Improved date parsing to handle various formats:
  - Relative dates: "today", "tomorrow"
  - Day of week patterns: "Saturday, July 15th at 2:00 PM"
  - Month/day extraction: "July 15th", "December 1st"
  - Standard date formats
- Events with unset dates are sorted to the beginning

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified:**

#### **1. `/src/config/constants.js`**
- Added `MISSOURI_REGIONS` mapping object
- Maps TO role names to their abbreviated regional designations

#### **2. `/src/utils/embedBuilder.js`**
- Added `getMissouriRegion()` helper function
- Enhanced `parseEventDate()` with improved date parsing logic
- Added `sortEventsByDate()` function for chronological sorting
- Updated `createMultiEventAnnouncementEmbed()` to:
  - Sort events chronologically
  - Display Missouri regions when available
  - Handle TO role information per event
- Updated `createSingleEventAnnouncementEmbed()` to display regions

#### **3. `/src/handlers/multiEventHandler.js`**
- Updated method signatures to pass session information
- Modified event storage to include TO role information with each event
- Updated embed creation calls to pass TO role data
- Enhanced fallback error handling

#### **4. `/src/handlers/announcementHandler.js`**
- Updated preview embed creation to include TO role information

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Missouri Region Display**
1. When a Missouri TO creates an event, their role is stored with the event data
2. The region abbreviation is extracted from the TO role name
3. For Missouri events, the region appears as `**[REGION]** 🏆 Tournament Name`
4. Other event types (Local, Out of State, Online) show normal titles

### **Chronological Sorting**
1. When adding a new event to an existing multi-event announcement
2. All events are sorted by their parsed start time dates
3. Events with earlier dates appear first
4. Events with no set dates appear at the beginning
