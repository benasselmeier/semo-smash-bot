# 🎉 MULTI-EVENT ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM - COMPLETE! 

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

Your Discord bot now features a **comprehensive multi-event announcement system** that automatically organizes tournaments by type and consolidates them into clean, organized cards!

## 🚀 **What's New**

### **🔍 Automatic Event Type Detection**
- **SEMO TOs** (`TO (SEMO)`) → 🏠 **Local Events** (Green)
- **Online TOs** (`TO (Online)`) → 💻 **Online Events** (Blue)  
- **Other Regional TOs** → 🌍 **Out of Region Events** (Orange)

### **📋 Smart Event Consolidation**
- **First event** of a type creates a new announcement card
- **Additional events** of the same type get added to existing card
- **Different types** get separate cards for clear organization
- **Role notifications** combined intelligently

### **🎨 Visual Organization**
- **Color-coded** by event type for instant recognition
- **Separated sections** within each card for multiple events
- **Professional formatting** with clear separators between events
- **Consistent branding** across all announcement types

## 📖 **How To Use**

### **For Administrators:**
1. Run `/setup` to configure the bot initially
2. Ensure TO roles are properly assigned:
   - `TO (SEMO)` for local event organizers
   - `TO (Online)` for online event organizers  
   - Other regional roles (`TO (St. Louis)`, etc.) for out-of-region events

### **For Tournament Organizers:**
1. Use `/tourney create [slug]` or `/tourney manage` as usual
2. **Event type is automatically detected** from your role
3. System will either:
   - Add your event to an existing card of the same type
   - Create a new card if it's the first event of that type
4. Role notifications work as before, with smart consolidation

## 🎯 **Result: Clean, Organized Announcements**

Instead of multiple individual announcement messages, your channel will have:

```
🏠 Local Events (SEMO)          [GREEN CARD]
