# Multi-Event Announcement UI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 🎯 **Problem Solved**
The multi-event announcement cards had two issues:
1. **Duplicate headers** - "Local Events (SEMO)" appeared both outside and inside the embed
2. **Too much detail** - Venue and entry fees cluttered the condensed cards

### ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

#### **1. Removed Duplicate Header**
- **Before**: Header appeared both in message content AND embed title
- **After**: Header only appears in message content (outside embed)
- **Result**: Cleaner, non-redundant display

#### **2. Simplified Tournament Card Content**
- **Removed**: Venue Fee and Entry Fee from condensed cards
- **Kept**: Essential information only
- **Result**: Cleaner, more focused tournament cards

### 📋 **Current Multi-Event Card Format**

**Message Content (Outside Embed):**
```
🎮 **Local Events (SEMO)** 🎮

@SEMO Enjoyer - New tournament(s) announced!
```

**Embed Content (Inside Card):**
```
🏆 Tournament Name
📅 Start Time: [Time]
🎮 Events: [Events]
